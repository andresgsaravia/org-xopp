1. invoke ~org-xopp-new-figure~ and choose a name for the new .xopp file
2. draw something in the xournalpp window that opens, hit save

4. the figure you drew will be inserted in the org document without the background (transparent and trimmed with background removed).

- xournalpp pages are embedded into org's pdf/latex exports
