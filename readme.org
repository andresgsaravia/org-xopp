* example usage

1. invoke ~org-xopp-new-figure~ and choose a name for the new .xopp file
2. a link will be inserted in org mode, hit save (in org)
3. draw something in the xournalpp window that opens, then hit save in xournalpp
4. reload org file (kill/reopen or using ~find-file~)
5. the figure you drew will be inserted in the org document without the background (transparent and trimmed with background removed).

* installation

using ~elpaca~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (use-package org-xopp
    :after (org)
    :ensure ( :host github :repo "mahmoodsheikh36/org-xopp")
    :config
    (org-xopp-setup))
#+end_src

using ~straight~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (straight-use-package
   '(org-xopp :type git :host github :repo "mahmoodsheikh36/org-xopp"))
#+end_src

* features

- two org links are defined, ~xopp-figure~ and ~xopp-pages~, the first is used for figures (single-page drawings) and will be extracted and previewed in org, the latter is embedded in the pdf exports as part of the document (without extracting figures).
- xournalpp pages are embedded into org's pdf/latex exports

* requirements

- imagemagick: 'convert' command should be available.
- xournalpp

* todos

- only regenerate pdf/image files if the corresponding .xopp files have changed
- handle edge cases (errors in image generation, etc)
- live sync of figures (automatically display changes in org every time a linked .xopp file is modified)
